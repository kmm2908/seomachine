# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Session Start

At the start of every new session, automatically invoke `/start` before responding to anything else.

## Agent Usage

Offload research, writing, file operations, and batch tasks to sub-agents wherever possible to keep the main conversation context clean. Prefer `run_in_background: true` for any task that doesn't need its result before the next step.

**Long-running publish runs must always use a background agent.** Any task that chains multiple `publish_scheduled.py` runs (e.g. publishing a full queue of 3–6 pages) will trip the Claude Code UI timeout ("Not responding") if run directly. The standard pattern:

```
Agent prompt: "Run these commands in sequence in /path/to/seomachine, one at a time, 300000ms timeout each:
  python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtm --queue comp-alt-queue.json  (×N)
Report back: client, topic, status, post ID, cost per run."
run_in_background: true
```

This applies to: `publish_scheduled.py` multi-run batches, `geo_batch_runner.py` on large Sheet ranges, and any other task expected to take >2 minutes total.

## Project Overview

SEO Machine is a Claude Code workspace for creating SEO-optimised content at scale. It combines custom commands, specialised agents, a Python batch runner, and Google Sheets integration to research, write, optimise, and publish articles for multiple business clients.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r data_sources/requirements.txt
```

API credentials go in `.env` at the project root (copy from `.env.example`):
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for the batch runner
- `GEO_LOCATIONS_SHEET_ID` — Google Sheet ID for the content queue
- `GA4_CREDENTIALS_PATH` — path to service account JSON
- DataForSEO, GSC, and SMTP email settings (optional)

WordPress credentials are configured per client in `clients/[abbr]/config.json` (not in `.env`).

## Client Structure

Each client lives in a single folder. To add a new client, run `/new-client`.

```
clients/
  gtm/                  ← Glasgow Thai Massage (live, publishing active)
  gtb/                  ← Glasgow Thai Massage Blog (blog.glasgowthaimassage.co.uk)
  sdy/                  ← Serendipity Massage Therapy & Wellness (live, batch publishing active)
  tmg/                  ← Thai Massage Greenock (thaimassagegreenock.co.uk)
  tmb/                  ← Thai Massage Greenock Blog (blog.thaimassagegreenock.co.uk)
    config.json         ← machine-readable config (name, address, WP creds, services)
    brand-voice.md      ← tone, messaging pillars, client-specific writing rules
    seo-guidelines.md   ← keyword strategy, entity optimisation rules
    internal-links-map.md
    features.md
    competitor-analysis.md
    target-keywords.md
    writing-examples.md
  README.md             ← schema docs and how to add new clients
```

**Local/live config pattern** — when a client has a local dev environment, `config.json` uses `wordpress` for the active target and `wordpress_live` to store live credentials. For Phase 2 (push to live), copy `wordpress_live` values into `wordpress`.

**Niche field** — `config.json` includes a `"niche"` key (e.g. `"thai-massage"`, `"massage-therapy"`). Used by `research_blog_topics.py` to cache keyword research at `research/niches/[niche]/` and share it across all clients in the same niche. Blog subdomain clients (e.g. GTB) use the same niche as their main site (GTM). Add a new niche slug when onboarding a client in a different market.

**AI visibility field** — `config.json` includes an optional `"ai_visibility"` block with three sub-fields: `canonical_description` (exact brand description used verbatim by writing agents), `brand_associations` (keyword phrases to weave into content), and `positioning_note` (tone guidance). Injected as a `## AI Brand Positioning` section in system prompts for `blog` and `topical` content types only — applies to both the batch runner and the scheduled publisher, which share the same `build_system_prompt()` function. See `context/ai-brand-visibility.md` for the strategy behind this. Full schema in `clients/README.md`.

Global context (not client-specific) stays in `context/`:
- `context/style-guide.md` — universal grammar, formatting, writing rules (including no-hyphens rule)
- `context/cro-best-practices.md` — conversion optimisation principles
- `context/ai-brand-visibility.md` — strategy for getting brands cited in LLM/AI answers (Brian Dean); consult when planning content marketing strategy, content distribution, or off-site brand building

## Content Pipeline

```
Google Sheet queue → src/content/geo_batch_runner.py → content/[abbr]/[type]/
Topic queue file  → src/content/publish_scheduled.py → content/[abbr]/[type]/  (cron-driven, no Sheet)
```

Slash command pipeline (interactive):
`topics/` → `research/` (briefs) → `drafts/` (articles) → `review-required/` → `published/`

Rewrites: `rewrites/` | Landing pages: `landing-pages/` | Audits: `audits/`

## Content Types

The batch runner and agents support 5 content types, selected via Column E in the Google Sheet:

| Type | Agent | Word Count | Use for |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| `service` | `service-page-writer.md` | 400–600 | Individual treatment/service pages |
| `location` | `location-page-writer.md` | 450+ | District, neighbourhood, or postcode-level location pages |
| `pillar` | `pillar-page-writer.md` | 700–1000 | GBP category landing pages (hub pages) |
| `topical` | `topical-writer.md` | 600–1000 | Informational/question-based articles |
| `blog` | `blog-post-writer.md` | 600–1200 | Conversational blog posts |
| `comp-alt` | `competitor-alt-writer.md` | 500–700 | Competitor alternative / comparison pages |

Default: `blog` if Column E is empty.

## Batch Runner

```bash
python3 src/content/geo_batch_runner.py             # process all "Write Now" rows
python3 src/content/geo_batch_runner.py A2:E5       # specific range only
python3 src/content/geo_batch_runner.py --publish   # generate + publish to WordPress as draft
```

Google Sheet columns: A=Topic/Location, B=Status (`Write Now`/`DONE`/`pause`/`Images o/s`/`Review`/`Publish`), C=Cost (auto), D=Business abbreviation, E=Content type, F=File path (auto-set on `Images o/s`/`Review`, cleared on DONE), G=Notes (quality failures on `Review`, cleared on DONE), H=Review count (increments each time a row is flagged `Review`), I=Niche (set by `research_blog_topics.py --sheet`; read-only for batch runner).

Output: `content/[abbr]/[type]/[slug]-[date]/[slug]-[date].html` (one folder per article; images saved alongside HTML)

**Scheduled publisher** — `src/content/publish_scheduled.py` publishes one topic per cron run from a JSON queue file, bypassing the Google Sheet entirely. Default queue: `research/[abbr]/topic-queue.json`. Use `--queue <filename>` to point at a different queue file (e.g. `comp-alt-queue.json`). Generate blog queues with `research_blog_topics.py --queue [--cadence N]`; comp-alt queues are hand-curated JSON files. Each run: picks next `pending` topic → generates content → quality gate → publishes to WordPress → marks topic `published`/`failed`/`review_required` in queue → appends to `logs/scheduled-publish-log.csv` → sends email. Missed-run detection: checks gap since last publish vs cadence + 2-day buffer. `--status` flag prints a formatted queue table (icons: ✓ published · · pending · ⚠ review · ✗ failed). `--dry-run` skips WordPress publish.

**Comp-alt queue files** — `research/[abbr]/comp-alt-queue.json`. Hand-curated list of competitor names (must match `###` headings in `competitor-analysis.md`). Run via: `python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtm --queue comp-alt-queue.json`. Always publish via background agent when running multiple topics (see Agent Usage above).

Cron examples:
- Blog (every Monday 09:00): `0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/seomachine && python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtb`
- Comp-alt (Wednesdays GTM, Thursdays SDY): `0 10 * * 3 ... --abbr gtm --queue comp-alt-queue.json`

**Directions snippet** — `src/snippets/generate_directions_snippet.py` generates a self-contained HTML+JS Google Maps directions widget per client. Saved to `clients/[abbr]/snippets/[abbr]-directions.html`. The batch runner calls `_ensure_directions_snippet()` automatically on the first publish run per client — no manual step needed. The snippet is injected into `comp-alt` page prompts automatically.

**Quality gate** runs after every article is written. Thresholds are per-content-type (`CONTENT_TYPE_CONFIG` in `quality_gate.py`). Hook and CTAs are mandatory for all types. Default (blog/location/service/etc.): Flesch ≥ 55, need 2/3 of stories/rhythm/paragraphs. `comp-alt`: Flesch ≥ 48, no stories criterion, need 1/2 of rhythm/paragraphs. If it fails, Claude rewrites with targeted instructions, up to 2 rewrites. Console output:
```
→ Quality: Flesch 55 ✓ | hook ✓ | ctas ✓ | stories ✗ | rhythm ✓ | paras ✓ — passed
```
On final failure: best rewrite saved to disk, row marked `Review` in Sheet, failures written to Column G, publish skipped.

**Review workflow:** manually edit the HTML file (path in Column F, failures in Column G), then set Column B to `Publish`. Next batch run publishes the file without regenerating content, marks DONE, clears G and F.

Quality failures logged to `logs/quality-log.csv` (append-only, gitignored).

## Content Repurposing Pipeline

Two-stage automated pipeline: blog publishes first (existing), then `src/social/repurpose_content.py` runs ~2 hours later, generating video + social media content and scheduling via GoHighLevel.

```bash
python3 src/social/repurpose_content.py --abbr gtm           # process all unrepurposed articles
python3 src/social/repurpose_content.py --abbr gtm --dry-run  # generate content, skip GHL publishing
python3 src/social/repurpose_content.py --abbr gtm --status   # show social publishing status
python3 src/social/repurpose_content.py --abbr gtm --topic "Thai Massage Benefits"  # specific article
```

Cron example (2hr after blog publish):
```
0 11 * * 1 cd /path/to/seomachine && python3 src/social/repurpose_content.py --abbr gtm
```

**Pipeline flow:** Published article → Claude generates video script + social posts → ElevenLabs TTS voiceover → FFmpeg composes long-form video (slides, Ken Burns, text overlays) + 3-5 shorts → GoHighLevel API schedules everything with staggered weekly spread (YouTube Tue, LinkedIn/FB/GBP Wed, X Thu, Instagram Fri, remaining shorts Sat-Sun).

**Modules:**
- `src/social/social_post_generator.py` — Claude-powered video script + social post generation
- `src/social/video_producer.py` — ElevenLabs TTS + FFmpeg video composition (long-form + shorts)
- `data_sources/modules/elevenlabs_tts.py` — ElevenLabs TTS wrapper with timestamp support
- `data_sources/modules/ghl_publisher.py` — GoHighLevel Social Planner API client (Private Integration tokens, media upload, post scheduling)

**Client config:** `elevenlabs.voice_id` for per-client voice, `ghl.location_id` + `ghl.accounts` for platform account IDs. GHL Private Integration tokens stored in `clients/[abbr]/ghl-tokens.json` (gitignored, format: `{"token": "pit-..."}`).

**X format alternation:** Even ISO weeks → thread format, odd weeks → standalone tweets staggered across the week. Controlled by `get_x_format_for_date()` in `ghl_publisher.py`.

**Logging:** `logs/social-publish-log.csv` — tracks repurposed articles, video status, shorts count, GHL post IDs, cost.

**Cost:** ~$2.95/article (Claude ~$0.15 + ElevenLabs TTS ~$2.40 + FFmpeg/Pillow free + GHL free).

**Future:** HeyGen AI avatar swap-in (clean TTS interface), per-client schedule config in config.json.

Set `IMAGE_API_PROVIDER=gemini` in `.env` to generate images automatically. Requires `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Leave blank to skip image generation (content-only mode). Cost: ~$0.27/post (Gemini) or ~$0.16/post (DALL-E 3 fallback).

**Image failure handling:** if image generation fails after 3 Gemini retries (30s/60s/120s backoff), the runner automatically falls back to DALL-E 3. If both fail and `--publish` is set, the row is marked `Images o/s` and the file path written to Column F — content is saved locally but not published. Next batch run retries images only (no content regeneration) and publishes on success.

**Nano Banana images** — for standalone/on-demand image generation (not batch runner), use the `nano-banana-images` skill (Kie.ai API, ~$0.04–0.09/image). Say "make me a nano banana image of..." to generate hyper-realistic images via Gemini 3.1 Flash. API key: `KIE_AI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

**Image naming:** `{base-slug}-banner.jpg`, `{heading-slug}.jpg` (section 1), `{base-slug}-faq.jpg` (FAQ section). All names are keyword-rich — no generic `section-1.jpg` filenames.

**Image placement and alignment:**
- Banner (1200×500): `class="aligncenter"`, injected after the first sentence of section 1
- Section image (400×300): `class="alignright"`, after the 3rd paragraph of section 1
- FAQ image (400×300): `class="alignleft"`, 3 paragraphs before the end of section 1
- Section 2 (FAQ accordion): no image injected — both body images appear before FAQ starts

**Banner subject by content type:**
- `location`: banner shows the local area/street scene; section image shows spa treatment
- All other types: banner shows spa/treatment scene

## Commands (Slash)

All commands are in `.claude/commands/`. Key commands:

**Research:**
- `/research [topic]` — social research (Reddit/YouTube) → entity mapping → keyword research → section plan; generates brief in `research/`
- `/research-serp "keyword"` — SERP analysis with entity extraction
- `/research-gaps` — competitor keyword gap analysis
- `/research-topics` — topical authority cluster analysis
- `/research-trending` — trending queries from GSC
- `/research-performance` — analytics-driven priorities
- `/research-blog-topics [abbr]` — keyword-driven blog topic ideas with competitor SERP analysis; niche cache shared across clients (30-day TTL); add `--sheet` to push to Google Sheet (status: pause)

**Writing:**
- `/write [topic]` — full article in `drafts/`, auto-triggers SEO agents
- `/article [topic]` — simplified article creation
- `/rewrite [topic]` — update existing content
- `/geo-batch` — batch content from Google Sheet (runs `src/content/geo_batch_runner.py`)

**Publishing & Optimisation:**
- `/publish-draft [file]` — publish to WordPress via REST API
- `/optimize [file]` — final SEO polish pass
- `/analyze-existing [URL or file]` — content health audit
- `/cluster [topic]` — topic cluster strategy

**Landing Pages:**
- `/landing-write`, `/landing-audit`, `/landing-research`, `/landing-publish`, `/landing-competitor`

## Agents

Located in `.claude/agents/`. Content writers:
- `service-page-writer.md`, `location-page-writer.md`, `pillar-page-writer.md`
- `topical-writer.md`, `blog-post-writer.md`

All 5 content writers output **three HTML blocks**:
1. `<!-- SECTION 1 -->` — main body
2. `<!-- SECTION 2 FAQ -->` — collapsible accordion using `<details>`/`<summary>` (no JS/CSS)
3. `<!-- SCHEMA -->` — JSON-LD with `@graph` containing the primary type (`Article`/`BlogPosting`/`Service`/`WebPage`), `FAQPage`, and `LocalBusiness` on every page

SEO/optimisation agents (auto-run after `/write`):
- `seo-optimizer.md`, `meta-creator.md`, `internal-linker.md`, `keyword-mapper.md`
- `content-analyzer.md`, `editor.md`, `headline-generator.md`, `cro-analyst.md`
- `performance.md`, `cluster-strategist.md`

## SEO Approach

Content is written entity-first, not keyword-first. See `clients/[abbr]/seo-guidelines.md`.

Key principle: identify the primary entity and 3–5 secondary entities before writing. Entity co-occurrence and salience take priority over keyword density targets. The `/research` command now outputs an Entity Map as its first section.

## WordPress Integration

Publishing uses the WordPress REST API. Credentials are stored in `clients/[abbr]/config.json` under the `wordpress` key. The custom MU-plugin (`wordpress/seomachine.php`) registers 5 custom post types and exposes SEO meta fields via REST — no Yoast dependency.

**SiteGround hosting note:** deploy to `wp-content/mu-plugins/` (plural). SiteGround also has a `mu-plugin/` (singular) folder which is display-only — WordPress does not auto-load PHP files from it.

**Auto-deploy:** `.github/workflows/deploy-plugin.yml` deploys `wordpress/seomachine.php` to all three sites automatically on every push to `main` that touches that file. Two parallel jobs: GTM/GTB (`u2168-sqqieazmgeuw@ukm1.siteground.biz`) and SDY (`u2732-2mxetksmslhk@gukm1055.siteground.biz`). Uses `SITEGROUND_SSH_KEY` GitHub Actions secret (private key at `~/.ssh/seomachine_deploy`).

`WordPressPublisher.from_config(wp_config)` accepts credentials directly from the client JSON.

**Batch runner publishing** uses `publish_html_content()` — extracts title from `<h2>`, uploads all local images to WP media library (rewriting relative `src` to absolute URLs), sets first image as featured image. The original topic/address from the Sheet is passed as `excerpt` — this powers the `[seo_hub]` shortcode display text.

**Re-publishing existing HTML files** (without regenerating content):
```bash
python3 src/content/republish_existing.py                # republish all gtm location files
python3 src/content/republish_existing.py --type service # service pages
python3 src/content/republish_existing.py --abbr gtm --type blog
```
Use this when posts need to be re-created in WordPress (e.g. after enabling Elementor CPT support).

**Custom post types** — content is published to the correct CPT based on content type. Mapping is in `clients/[abbr]/config.json` under `wordpress.content_type_map`. CPTs: `seo_service`, `seo_location`, `seo_pillar`, `seo_topical`, `seo_blog`, `seo_comp_alt`. All grouped under "SEO Content" in wp-admin. SEO meta fields (`seo_meta` REST field) work without Yoast — keys are Yoast-compatible so they display in Yoast UI if installed.

**Elementor template publishing** (used when `clients/[abbr]/elementor-template.json` exists):
1. Run `python3 src/publishing/fetch_elementor_template.py [abbr]` once to capture the saved template (reads `wordpress.elementor_template_id` from config). Skips SSL verification automatically for `.local` domains. Saves a `clients/[abbr]/elementor-template-meta.json` sidecar with the WP `modified` date.
2. Before every publish, the batch runner checks whether the template has been updated in WordPress (compares `modified` date via REST API) and auto-re-fetches if stale. Prints `→ Template: up to date` or `→ Template updated in WordPress — re-fetching...`. Checked once per client per run.
2. On `--publish`, article HTML is injected into the template's HTML widget(s); first `<h2>` stripped (template has H1 title widget); schema `<script>` appended directly; list spacing fixed via inline styles
3. Post created as the correct CPT (e.g. `seo_location`) with `_elementor_data` + `_elementor_edit_mode: builder` meta

**Two-section injection mode** (SDY template): if the template contains HTML widgets with `<!-- S1 CONTENT -->` and `<!-- S2 CONTENT -->` markers, the injector splits automatically — Section 1 body → S1 widget, FAQ accordion → S2 widget (with schema appended). The Button section between them is left untouched. Falls back to single-widget mode (GTM) if markers are absent.

**GTM config:** `clients/gtm/config.json` — `wordpress.elementor_template_id: 16508`, `wordpress.content_type_map` maps all 5 types to CPT slugs

**SDY config:** `clients/sdy/config.json` — `wordpress` block points to live (`serendipitymassage.co.uk`); `elementor_template_id: 564`; `wordpress_local` block preserves local credentials for reference

**Elementor CPT auto-enable** — `seomachine.php` filters `option_elementor_cpt_support` and `default_option_elementor_cpt_support` to auto-enable all 5 CPTs in Elementor without manual checkbox step. No Elementor → Settings action required on new installs.

**Hub page shortcode** — `[seo_hub type="location"]` registered in `seomachine.php`. Place in an Elementor Shortcode widget (not HTML widget). Renders a `<ul class="seo-hub-links">` of all published posts of that type, sorted A–Z, each wrapped in `<li><h3><a>`. Display text = post excerpt if set, otherwise post title. Supported types: `location`, `service`, `pillar`, `topical`, `blog`. Must be deployed to `wp-content/mu-plugins/seomachine.php` (not inside `plugins/`).

**Cross-site hub (blog subdomains)** — on blog subdomains (GTB, TMB), set `wp option update seo_hub_source "https://main-site-url.com"`. The shortcode fetches posts from the main site's REST API (no auth needed — public CPTs) and caches results for 12 hours. The `blog` type always queries locally. Override per-shortcode: `[seo_hub type="location" source="https://..."]`. Cache bust: `wp transient delete seo_hub_cache_location`.

**Schema handling (non-Elementor)**: `_wrap_schema_block()` moves the `<!-- SCHEMA --><script>` block into a Gutenberg `<!-- wp:html -->` block. The `[DATE]` placeholder is replaced with today's ISO date by the batch runner before saving.

## Project Structure

All Python executables live in `src/` under module subfolders. Test scripts live in `tests/`. Modules (imported by scripts) stay in `data_sources/modules/`. GCP service account keys go in `config/`.

```
src/
  content/      ← geo_batch_runner.py, republish_existing.py, publish_scheduled.py
  research/     ← research_competitors.py, research_quick_wins.py, research_serp_analysis.py, etc.
  publishing/   ← fetch_elementor_template.py
  snippets/     ← generate_directions_snippet.py
  social/       ← repurpose_content.py, video_producer.py, social_post_generator.py
  competitors/  ← competitor alternative page generators (future)
tests/          ← test scripts (delete before production)
data_sources/   ← importable modules (google_sheets, wordpress_publisher, elevenlabs_tts, ghl_publisher, etc.)
config/         ← service account keys (gitignored)
clients/        ← per-client context and config
```

Scripts in `src/` subfolders resolve the project root as `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`, so all paths (`content/`, `clients/`, `.env`) still resolve correctly when run from the project root.

## Python Analysis Pipeline

Located in `data_sources/modules/`. Scripts in `src/`:

```bash
python3 src/research/research_quick_wins.py
python3 src/research/research_competitor_gaps.py
python3 src/research/research_serp_analysis.py "keyword"
python3 src/research/research_topic_clusters.py
python3 src/research/research_trending.py
python3 src/research/research_competitors.py --abbr gtm   # full competitor research (map pack + organic + profiles)
python3 src/research/research_blog_topics.py --abbr gtb   # blog topic ideas (niche cache, 30-day TTL)
python3 src/research/research_blog_topics.py --abbr gtb --sheet   # also push to Sheet (status: pause)
python3 src/research/research_blog_topics.py --abbr gtb --refresh  # force cache refresh
python3 src/research/research_blog_topics.py --abbr gtb --queue    # write topic-queue.json for scheduled publishing
python3 src/research/research_blog_topics.py --abbr gtb --queue --cadence 14  # fortnightly cadence
python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtb          # publish next topic from queue
python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtb --status # show queue status table
python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtb --dry-run  # generate + quality-check, skip WP publish
python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtm --queue comp-alt-queue.json          # comp-alt queue
python3 src/content/publish_scheduled.py --abbr gtm --queue comp-alt-queue.json --status # comp-alt status
python3 tests/test_dataforseo.py    # test API connectivity
```

**`research_competitors.py`** — standalone competitor intelligence script. Reads `clients/[abbr]/config.json`, geocodes the `area` field via Nominatim (strips "City Centre" etc. before geocoding), queries DataForSEO for top 10 map pack results (`location_name` approach) + top 10 organic (UK, location code 2826), filters directory domains, scrapes each competitor site, extracts structured profiles via Claude Haiku, writes `clients/[abbr]/competitor-analysis.md`. Integrated into `/new-client` workflow as Step 5.

`dataforseo.get_maps_pack()` accepts both `location_name` (e.g. `"Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom"`) and `location_coordinate` (e.g. `"55.86,-4.25,10000"`).
